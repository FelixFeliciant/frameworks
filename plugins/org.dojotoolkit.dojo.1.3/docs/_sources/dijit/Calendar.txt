The Calendar widget displays a localized gregorian month-view calendar, and allows the user to navigate months and years as well as select a date.  To meet the accessibility requirements of dijit which require keyboard accessibility on input controls, the Calendar must be used in conjunction with :ref:`DateTextBox <dijit/DateTextBox>`. A read-only calendar view can easily be added to a page as seen in the demo below.

An enhanced but still experimental version of Calendar which has additional capabilities like year-only views and animation effects is under development in dojox/widget/Calendar.
