Welcome to Dojo Toolkits new official documentation pages.

The documentation is aiming to cover all dojo modules delivered within a release. 

This is an open effort for anyone interested to join. If you are missing things or have ideas, then

* update our :ref:`ToDo list <todo>`
* read the :ref:`Documentation guidelines <howto>` and insert your own bits of knowledge
* don't hesitate to contact the documentation team.

Please read the :ref:`documentation howto <howto>` before starting writing docs.

Search the docs
===============

Use the search box, it is very helpful and usually brings you to the page you need. If you are for example looking for "dojo.data.ItemFileReadStore" simply enter "itemfilereadstore".
