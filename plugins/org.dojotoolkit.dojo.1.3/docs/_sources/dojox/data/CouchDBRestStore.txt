**dojox.data.CouchDBRestStore** is a subclass of `JsonRestStore <dojo/data/JsonRestStore>` for connecting to CouchDB <http://couchdb.org/>.


============
Introduction
============

CouchDBRestStore essentially has the same functionality as JsonRestStore, but has some extra adaptations for automatic creation of stores based on CouchDB's database listing and working properly with CouchDB's idiosyncrasies.

=====
Usage
=====

You can create a set of stores for all available CouchDB tables/databases:

.. code-block :: javascript

 myStores = dojox.data.CouchDBRestStore.getStores("http://192.168.0.68:5984/_utils/");

This will return a object where each property name is the name of the store, and each value is the actual store for interacting with the CouchDB database.
