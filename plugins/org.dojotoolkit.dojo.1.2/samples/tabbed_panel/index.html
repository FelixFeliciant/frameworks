      Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by
      every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother,
      and there was nothing that she would not have given to the child.

      Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife
      and his two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel.
      He had little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell
      on the land, he could no longer procure even daily bread.

      There was once upon a time a hermit who lived in a forest at the foot
      of a mountain, and passed his time in prayer and good works,
      and every evening he carried, to the glory of God, two pails of water
      up the mountain.
